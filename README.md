Hello this project was one of the projects , I was most excited about ,Fine tuning a llm was in my wishlist since start as ,I dont have enough resources to build my own llm model but this was the closesst, I couls do.
I used the peft technique and quantized the model thorugh qlora from bfloat16 to normalfloat 4 as , I dont't have a powerful enough gpu then I used hugging face for medical data to for aq type chatbot i converted the data so that it is supported format of gpt2.
I played with different hyperparameter tuning features for best possible results and finally the epochs ran, The results after thr tuning are acceptable but not great buty overall it was good and learned a lot on the way .
