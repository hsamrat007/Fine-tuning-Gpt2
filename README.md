This repository contains code and resources for fine-tuning a GPT-2 model on medical data using advanced techniques such as PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) and QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation). The model is designed to generate healthcare-related text based on the [medalpaca/medical_meadow_wikidoc_patient_information](https://huggingface.co/datasets/medalpaca/medical_meadow_wikidoc_patient_information) dataset.

## Features

- Fine-tune GPT-2 on medical data using PEFT and QLoRA
- Efficient training with reduced memory footprint
- Generate healthcare-related text
- Easy-to-use training and inference scripts

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-gpt2-finetuning.git
   cd healthcare-gpt2-finetuning
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset

The training dataset is sourced from the [medalpaca/medical_meadow_wikidoc_patient_information](https://huggingface.co/datasets/medalpaca/medical_meadow_wikidoc_patient_information) dataset available on Hugging Face Datasets. This dataset contains medical information suitable for training healthcare language models.

## Techniques Used

### PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)
PEFT enables fine-tuning of large pre-trained models by updating only a small subset of their parameters, reducing computational requirements and allowing for efficient adaptation to specific tasks.

### QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)
QLoRA is a quantization technique that reduces the model's memory footprint by representing model weights with lower precision (e.g., 4-bit). This allows for handling larger models on resource-constrained hardware.

### Hugging Face Transformers
We use the `transformers` library to load pre-trained models, manage tokenization, and facilitate fine-tuning. Our model is based on GPT-2, a popular generative model for text.

### Datasets Library
The `datasets` library is utilized to load and preprocess the dataset, providing tools for easy manipulation of data.

### Trainer API
We employ the Trainer API to handle the fine-tuning process, simplifying the training loop and providing a high-level interface for training, evaluation, and model saving.

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the model, run the following command:

```
python train.py --model_name "openai-community/gpt2" --output_dir "./healthcare_gpt2model" --num_train_epochs 3
```

You can customize training parameters by modifying the `train.py` script or passing command-line arguments.

### Inference

To generate text using the fine-tuned model:

```python
from inference import load_model, generate_response

model, tokenizer = load_model("./healthcare_gpt2model")
input_text = "Patient symptoms include fever and cough."
generated_text = generate_response(model, tokenizer, input_text)
print(generated_text)
```
